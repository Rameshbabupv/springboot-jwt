# Feature Specification: Core Application Foundation with Hello World Endpoints

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need to define the initial specification for a new application.

The application **must** provide a minimal, foundational set of services to establish its core functionality.

Specifically, it needs to expose a **basic 'hello world' message through a standard REST API endpoint**. This endpoint should respond with a simple, predefined greeting when accessed.

Additionally, the application **must offer a similar 'hello world' response via a GraphQL endpoint**. This endpoint should allow queries that return a basic, predefined greeting.

The purpose of these initial endpoints is to **establish a verifiable core application capable of demonstrating basic request-response cycles for both REST and GraphQL interactions**. This foundational specification serves as the blueprint for an extensible system, ready for the future addition of functional modules."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system integrator or developer, I need to verify that the core application is operational and can respond to basic requests through both REST and GraphQL interfaces, so that I can confirm the foundational infrastructure is working before adding additional functional modules.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is running, **When** I send a GET request to the REST hello world endpoint, **Then** I receive a 200 status code with a predefined greeting message
2. **Given** the application is running, **When** I send a GraphQL query for the hello world message, **Then** I receive a successful response with a predefined greeting message
3. **Given** the application is starting up, **When** both endpoints are initialized, **Then** the system logs successful initialization of REST and GraphQL capabilities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the application receives malformed requests to either endpoint?
- How does the system respond when endpoints are accessed before full application startup?
- What occurs if either the REST or GraphQL service fails to initialize?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST expose a REST API endpoint that returns a hello world greeting message
- **FR-002**: System MUST expose a GraphQL endpoint that returns a hello world greeting message through queries
- **FR-003**: System MUST return consistent, predefined greeting messages from both endpoints
- **FR-004**: System MUST respond with appropriate HTTP status codes for successful requests
- **FR-005**: System MUST be accessible and operational for external requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST demonstrate basic request-response cycles for both REST and GraphQL interactions
- **FR-007**: System MUST serve as a verifiable foundation for future module additions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Greeting Message**: A simple text response containing a predefined hello world message, returned by both REST and GraphQL endpoints
