**Feature Branch**: `002-next-we-are`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Next we are going to connect postgres SQL server and work on CURD operration on Company master please think hard and make sure we meet the requirments and not to over do over implemt it."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: PostgreSQL integration + Company master CRUD operations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: System users, Company data administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: Create, Read, Update, Delete company records
   ‚Üí Data: Company master information
   ‚Üí Constraints: Don't over-implement, meet requirements only
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow for company data management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and focused on core CRUD operations
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Company master entity with essential attributes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Several [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items identified
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What specific information should be stored for each Company record? ‚Üí A: Basic info only (company name, registration number)
- Q: What user roles/permissions are required for different Company operations? ‚Üí A: Only app-admins and platform-admins Keycloak roles
- Q: Should company record deletions be soft (hidden) or hard (permanent)? ‚Üí A: Disable - mark as inactive but keep visible
- Q: Should the system support single operations only or also batch operations? ‚Üí A: Single operations with optional bulk import feature
- Q: Are audit fields (created date, modified date, created by user) required for Company records? ‚Üí A: Full audit trail (timestamps + user tracking)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a business user, I need to manage company master data so that I can maintain accurate organizational information in the system. The system should allow me to create new company records, view existing companies, update company details when changes occur, and remove companies that are no longer relevant.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an authenticated user with app-admins or platform-admins role, **When** I create a new company record with valid information, **Then** the company is successfully saved and appears in the company list
2. **Given** company records exist in the system, **When** I request to view all companies, **Then** I receive a complete list of all company records with their details
3. **Given** I have a specific company selected, **When** I update its information with valid data, **Then** the changes are persisted and reflected in subsequent queries
4. **Given** I have identified a company to remove, **When** I delete the company record, **Then** the company is marked as inactive but remains visible in the system for audit purposes
5. **Given** I attempt to create a company with invalid or missing required information, **When** I submit the request, **Then** the system provides clear validation errors and does not save the record

### Edge Cases
- What happens when attempting to delete a company that has dependencies or relationships with other data?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same company record?
- What occurs when the database connection is temporarily unavailable during operations?
- How are large company lists handled for performance and usability?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authorized users to create new company master records with required company information
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to retrieve and view all company master records in a structured format
- **FR-003**: System MUST permit users to search for specific company records by company name or registration number
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to update existing company master record information
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable users to delete company master records from the system
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate company data before saving to ensure data integrity
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist all company master data in PostgreSQL database for reliable storage
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide appropriate error messages when operations fail
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain data consistency during concurrent access scenarios
- **FR-010**: System MUST support single company operations with optional bulk import feature for initial data loading
- **FR-011**: System MUST restrict company master operations to users with app-admins or platform-admins Keycloak roles from JWT token
- **FR-012**: System MUST disable company records by marking them as inactive while keeping them visible for audit purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain full audit trail with timestamps and user tracking for all company record operations
