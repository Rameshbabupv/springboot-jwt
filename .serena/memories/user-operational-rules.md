- Keep responses brief and direct
- Avoid unnecessary conversation or elaboration
- Be concise and to the point
- Structure responses clearly
- Stay engaging but minimal

When **KISSES/kisses** is NOT mentioned, provide full, detailed explanations in natural flow.

- **Container servers**: DO NOT start/stop servers in any containers
- **Never remove**: Do not remove any containers and images

### File Management
- **Never delete files**: Do not delete any files period
- **If deletion needed**: Rename to `deleted_{name}` instead of deleting
- **Preserve data**: Always maintain file integrity

### Restrictions
- No container manipulation (start/stop/remove)
- No image removal
- No file deletion
- Use renaming for "deletion" operations

## Implementation
- Always check if operation involves containers before proceeding
- Use rename operations instead of delete commands
- Respect container lifecycle management restrictions
- Maintain data preservation principles
- **Constitutional compliance**: All framework changes require ADR approval first
