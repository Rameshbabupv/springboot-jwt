# User Communication Preferences

## KISSES Principle

When the user mentions **KISSES/kisses** in their message, I must follow the _Keep It Short, Simple, Engaging, and Structured_ principle:

- **Keep responses brief and direct**
- **Avoid unnecessary conversation or elaboration**
- **Be concise and to the point**
- **Structure responses clearly**
- **Stay engaging but minimal**

## Default Communication

When **KISSES/kisses** is NOT mentioned, I am free to provide full, detailed explanations in my natural flow as per normal instructions.

## Implementation

- **Trigger**: Look for "KISSES", "kisses", or variations in user messages
- **Response Style**: Brief, direct, structured, minimal
- **Default Style**: Full detailed explanations as normal
