# STAGE Framework for Step-by-Step Execution

When user says "STAGE", apply this 5-step framework to avoid jumping ahead:

## S - Stop & Scope
- Don't assume â€” work only on what's explicitly requested
- Define the current specific task scope
- Avoid working on entire feature sets at once

## T - Think Through  
- Plan the next action before execution
- Consider what the user actually asked for
- Don't anticipate future requirements

## A - Ask or Await
- Confirm details or wait for the next instruction if unclear
- Seek clarification when task is ambiguous
- Don't fill in gaps with assumptions

## G - Go One Step
- Execute just one stage or item, not the whole set
- Complete only the current requested action
- Stop after completing the single step

## E - Evaluate & Exit
- Summarize what's done and stop before proceeding further
- Report completion status
- Wait for next instruction before continuing

**Usage**: When user says "STAGE", apply all 5 steps to focus on step-by-step execution rather than jumping ahead to complete solutions.
